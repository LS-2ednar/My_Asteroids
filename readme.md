This is a fun little project with pygame to recreate the classic Asteroids game


The current iteration works as follows:

The Player a Triangle (aka. our fancy space ship) tries to destroy asteroids and survive as long as possible.

The asteroids come in 3 different categories.
large
medium 
small

When a large or medium asteroid is hit by a shot from our player character, the asteroid is decreasing in size until it fits the small cateogire. If a small asteroid is hit it is finally killed for good and only vapour remains.

If any asteroid hits the player the game ends
